// üß† Stack vs Heap in Rust (Short Notes)

// üóÇ Stack:
// - Fast, LIFO memory (Last In First Out).
// - Stores fixed-size data (e.g., integers, function calls).
// - Automatically allocated and deallocated.
// - Example: let x = 5; // stored on the stack

// üì¶ Heap:
// - Slower, flexible memory for dynamically sized data.
// - Must request memory (e.g., Box, String, Vec).
// - Manually managed via ownership and borrowing.
// - Example: let s = String::from("hello"); // string data is stored on heap

// üîÅ Ownership in Rust ensures safe heap usage without garbage collector.

// stack pushed a unique stack frame in memory for each specific function and inside that stack frame for unique function, it stores all the variables.
// if a function is calling another function that passes and uses the same variable from main function, then a new stack frame will be created in the memory.
